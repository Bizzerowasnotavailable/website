    <h1>Windows 7 Survival Guide for 2024 and 2025</h1>

    <p>Windows 7 was released all the way back in 2009 as a tune-up for the notorious Windows Vista. In 2020, Microsoft decided to end support for Windows 7, and with the release of Windows 11, it seems like the remaining Windows 7 user base has dwindled as well. However, there are still people who, for one reason or another, care about this aging operating systemâ€”myself included. Hence, I created this guide to help the remaining few who refuse to update after all these years.</p>

    <h2>Software Compatibility</h2>
    <p>Windows 7 is starting to lose software support. However, with an app called <strong>VxKex</strong>, we can extend compatibility for some applications.</p>

    <h3>As of Nov 16, 2024, VxKex's development has been paused. <a href="https://github.com/vxiiduu/VxKex/releases/tag/stable">(Read more here)</a></h3>

    <h2>Web Browsing</h2>
    <p>The latest versions of the two major browsers, Chrome and Firefox, date back to 2023. Fortunately, the community has created forks of these browsers that are actively maintained for Windows 7.</p>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium-legacy">Thorium</a> and <a href="https://github.com/win32ss/supermium">Supermium</a> for Chrome/Chromium.</p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/Eclipse-Community/r3dfox/releases">R3dFox</a> for Firefox.</p>
    <h3>Note: I recommend using Firefox due to Google's decision to discontinue Manifest v2, which will affect extensions like uBlock Origin.</h3>

    <h2>Productivity</h2>
    <p>Office 2016 is the latest version of Microsoft Office for Windows 7. However, you can still use alternatives such as <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a>.</p>

    <p>For video editing, <strong>Capcut 2.5</strong> works fine on Windows 7. If you're familiar with it, I recommend using that version since it's one of the last versions with features that are now paywalled. For other applications like Premiere Pro, the latest version supported is from 2018. For image manipulation, I recommend using web-based tools like <a href="https://www.photopea.com/">Photopea</a>.</p>

    <h2>Gaming</h2>
    <p>After months of warnings that "Steam will stop working on Windows 7 and 8 in 0 days," it seems like Valve has finally discontinued the app for good. This means the only way to play games on Windows 7 is to sail the high seas. I personally haven't tested any of the other game stores like Epic Games or others, since I don't play games all that much, but you can test them yourself and send a pull request on this website's GitHub if you find that those stores work.</p>

    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>Spotify has a working client for Windows 7; however, manual login seems to be broken, which means you'll have to use either Google, Facebook, or Apple to log in. That said, the client seems to work fine. If you don't have a premium account and use something like <a href="https://spicetify.app/">Spicetify</a>, you might notice that you can't install it. This happens because Windows 7 doesn't ship with the right version of PowerShell; you need PowerShell 5.1 or greater, which can be downloaded online.</p>

    <h2>Communication</h2>
    <p>Even though VxKex claims to support Discord Canary, I couldn't get it to work. However, Discord Web via Chrome/Firefox (or the previously mentioned forks) works just fine. Telegram Desktop also works well; however, if executed without VxKex, it might throw an error for missing DLLs, but that doesn't stop the app from functioning. WhatsApp Desktop doesn't work anymore, but you can still use the web-based version.</p>
